Figure4 in the python notebook shows each POI group which is scaled in the range of -10 to 10.

Assumption: 
- POI1 and POI2 have the same latitude and longitude so both are merged and considered as POI1.
- POI1 and POI4 have significant outliers which may affect the results such as area and density so all outliers are removed.
- All the duplicate/identical data has been removed based on geoinfo and time.

Hypothesis:
POI1 has the highest density because it has more requests and a large area compare to the other two POIs.

Testing:
Question 3 asks for calculating density and radius which consider as a testing procedure and from that I can support the hypothesis.

Conclusion:
Given the testing results, we can say that the hypothesis is true and POI1 has the highest density.
